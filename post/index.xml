      <description>Python, it was a language I never knew I loved, and here&#39;s why: We started python in class pretty late. I was excited to learn a new language because I hear all these great things about how it is simpler than R. It was very easy to use and the format was easy to understand. Using the servers probably helped with that since everything was already uploaded for us. The two languages paired so well with one another, the complementation was much needed.</description>

      <description>This was how my Thanksgiving looked like! A cranberry citrus tart, recipe was from Claire Saffitz. Peaches from my mom&#39;s tree were turned into this beautiful peach crumble bar These are my crispy chocolate chip cookies I made a dinner celebrating my first real apartment for my family. I made roasted garlic mashed potatoes, american wagyu ribeye, mallard duck breast, A5 miyazaki wagyu, broccolini and campari tomatoes! I made &#39;cwispy&#39; fried chicken for my dad&#39;s birthday!</description>
